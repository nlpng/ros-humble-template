# ROS 2 Humble Package Template Tasks

## Project Setup
- [x] Review PLANNING.md (2025-05-25)
- [x] Create ROS 2 humble package template following package pattern (2025-05-25)
- [x] Implement proper colcon workspace structure following ROS 2 standards (2025-05-25)
- [x] Create package.xml with specification and proper dependencies (2025-05-25)
- [x] Create CMakeLists.txt following colcon build system best practices (2025-05-25)
- [x] Implement launch file with configurable parameters (2025-05-25)

## Docker Setup
- [x] Create the Dockerfile that host the ROS package (2025-05-25)
- [x] Create the docker-compose.yaml (2025-05-25)

## Documentation
- [x] Update README.md with setup and usage instructions (2025-05-25)

## Implementation Details Completed (2025-05-25)
- [x] ROS 2 C++ Node with publisher, subscriber, and timer functionality
- [x] ROS 2 Python Node with equivalent functionality
- [x] Publishers: status messages, counter, and simulated temperature data (both C++ and Python)
- [x] Subscriber: command velocity input processing (both C++ and Python)
- [x] Configurable parameters: publish_rate and topic_prefix (both packages)
- [x] Foxglove bridge integration for web visualization
- [x] Multi-stage Docker build with ros:humble-ros-base
- [x] Host networking configuration for proper ROS communication
- [x] Launch files with configurable parameters for both packages
- [x] Docker Compose with multiple deployment profiles (default, python, dual, multi-node)
- [x] Complete Python package structure with setup.py, setup.cfg, and __init__.py
- [x] Dual language support for maximum flexibility

## Python Package Features Added (2025-05-25)
- [x] Complete Python ROS 2 package structure following ament_python standards
- [x] Python node with identical functionality to C++ version
- [x] Separate launch file for Python package
- [x] Docker Compose profiles for Python-only and dual language deployment
- [x] Topic prefix differentiation (py_template vs template)
- [x] Comprehensive documentation for both C++ and Python usage

## Success Criteria Met
- [x] docker-compose up starts C++ services (default)
- [x] docker-compose --profile python up starts Python services
- [x] docker-compose --profile dual up runs both C++ and Python nodes
- [x] Topics visible with ros2 topic list for both implementations
- [x] Foxglove Studio connects via WebSocket (port 8765)
- [x] Template easily adaptable for other projects in both C++ and Python
- [x] Both packages can run independently or together
